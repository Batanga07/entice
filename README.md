## Project


This aims to create a game-server & client-modification for a popular MMO (can you guess which one? :P).
You can find more information on how it works in the subprojects of entice. If you're interested in using the API, you
can find the complete documentation here in this repository.

* [Milestones](https://github.com/entice/entice/blob/master/milestones.md) - These define the features we implemented and are working on
* [Routes](https://github.com/entice/entice/blob/master/routes.md) - The public & secured HTTP API for the server
* [Topics](https://github.com/entice/entice/blob/master/topics.md) - The secured Websocket API for the server as an overview. This is the place to start when you are looking for how things of this server work internally (API wise).
* [FAQ & Known Bugs](https://github.com/entice/entice/blob/master/faq.md) - Common questions and bugs that we encountered but could not fix or only work-around



## Overview


The client is a middle-man between the server and its API and the actual game-client. It modifies the latter ones
behaviour and encapsulates it in a way that all the game-client 'sees' of the world is this modified environment.
Every network communication is intercepted and reacted upon in this layer. This provides the benefit for the server
to use an entirely different protocol, and for the client to crash less often since yet unimplemented behaviour
of the server can be simulated in this layer.

The web project provides an HTTP/Websocket access point for any API consumer (mainly the client layer) and communicates
both with the database and the entity system. This provides every player with her own view of the ingame world.

The logic project aims to provide a boilerplate-less code base for the actual gameplay components that the web
project provides access to and the client uses. This is a consumer of the bare entity-framework that lies underneath.

The entity project provides a rather universial implementation of a distributed entity-component-system, which comes in
the shape of so called entities, attributes and behaviours. Attributes and behaviours are in contrast to components and
systems process-local copies of their counterparts. This design works especially well in a highly parallel environment.

The skill project provides implementation for the wide range of in-game skills the players can use. (This might
become part of the logic project in the future)

The utils project provides, as the name suggests, utility functionality for the server. Very universial and
unspecific components that are used in the other server projects reside here.
